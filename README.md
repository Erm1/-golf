				TTY GOLF

In this project, I have created and used six classes to effectively execute the game process.
The class with the main method is called golf.java and it calls for a method called lovegame()
found in the class GameIntro.java. Then the method lovegame() has a scanner to ask the user to 
choose between the available courses. based on the user input, It either calls for a method found 
in the class Course.java or the program quits if the user inputs an invalid course number. The instance
Course called play1 created in the GameIntro.java class helps us to call the methods in the Course.java
class. Then class Course extends playgame.java class where all the nested loops and conditionals of the game 
occurs. I have a comment for all the codes in my java program. I have also done a couple of extra credits and
the game sample is presented below.
